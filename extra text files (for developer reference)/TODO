Roadmap:
1: Add Integers (DONE)
2: Reimplement Matrices (DONE)
3: Add random module (DOING)
4: Update IterArray definition syntax (TODO)
5: Implement serialisation functions (TODO)
6: Implement mathematical functions (TODO)
7: Implement Automatic Differentiation (TODO)
8: Implement AI functions (TODO)
9: Allow structs to have bound methods (TODO)
10: Add function overloading (TODO)
11: Add explicit unions (TODO)
10: Make register-based VM using rust (TODO)


Immediate changes:
2: Implement AILang API for unsigned integer matrices
3: Implement AILang front-end for unsigned integers and unsigned integer matrices
4: Implement unsigned integers functionality for AILang lexer and parser
5: Implement Python APIs for RNG
6: Implement AILang front-end for RNG


Note:
Before trying to dig around in the parser because of a cryptic error message, check the .ail file's code carefully first!
