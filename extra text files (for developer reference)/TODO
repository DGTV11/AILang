Roadmap:
1: Add Integers (DOING)
2: Reimplement Matrices (DOING)
3: Fix error messages!!! (TODO)


Immediate changes:
1: Add broadcast function interfaces to 'BuiltInFunction's


Note:
Before trying to dig around in the parser because of a cryptic error message, look at the .ail file's code carefully first!
